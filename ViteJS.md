# Vite JS - Next Generation Frontend Tooling ðŸš€

- Vite is a Javascript build tool and it is created by Evan You (Creator of Vue)

- It serves your code locally during the development & it bundles your assets, Javascript, and CSS together for production.

- It improves the development experience by focusing on the speed and performance of the build process

## Why is Vite so unique compared to other bundlers?

- Other bundlers like webpack and rollup is also great and work well. But if you are working on a larger application that has more code and dependencies, it takes more time for generating the build and you might have noticed that it takes some time to reflect the change in the browser

- But on the other hand, Vite builds more quickly than other bundler no matter how large the application is.
